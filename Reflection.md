## Ways that Copilot aided me in this assignment:
- Suggested putting my class declatations in a shared folder for both the Client and the Server to access. This cut down on code repetition.
- Helped fix a CORS error that causes the Client to be unable to receive the data being sent from the Server.
- Suggested a JSON structure for the data being stored in the Server.
- Aided in code optimization.
